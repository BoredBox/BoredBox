- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BoredBox
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, k-dramas, k-pop, problem-solving, analyzing...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding, and Korean language...
- ðŸ“« You can reach me or message me on my FB account (https://www.facebook.com/tesorerojerico/)...
- I am still learning to code since I stopped learning last year so I hope I can go on the trend without affecting my learning while schooling...
